1) I have implmented the let and let* in all 4 interpreters including ValueStatic.ss
2) I have made two folders each of them containing all four interpreters.
	
	i) The folder "Environment as a function" contains all the 4 implemented interpreters but 
	the implmentation of the environment is unchanged.
	
	ii) The folder "Environment As a list" contains all the 4 implemented interpreters with 
	the implmentation of the environment as a list.

Please follow the logic the inside the 4 interpereter files to verify that.
